              <p><b>THE ORGANIZATION</b></p>
              <p>ION Racing is a student research project and a student
                organization at the University of Stavanger. We have already
                built three high-tech race cars in our own workshop at the
                university. Fall 2014 we started designing our fourth car. ION
                Racing competes in the largest student engineering competition
                in the world, Formula Student.<br><br>Formula Student is one of the
                most prestigious competitions a university can compete in and
                there are more than 600 universities competing worldwide. We
                compete in the event at Silverstone, the legendary formula-1
                track in England. </p>

              <p>Today, ION Racing is the biggest project at the University of
                Stavanger with over 60 active students from various programs. The
                majority of the students are engineering students (mechanical and
                electrical), but we also have students from economics, computer
                science, media and so on. We also take pride in being one of the
                most active social groups at the university, besides also having
                the largest Facebook group, with a reach near two thousand people.
                <br><br><b>Consequently, there are two main reasons for starting the
                student organization ION Racing in 2011.</b></p>

              <p><b>THE MISSION</b></p>
              <p>Students at a university today learn a lot of theory, but not so much
                practical work. This is where ION Racing comes in. Our mission
                is to create better engineers, the engineers of the future.
                This means teaching our members a better understanding of how
                things work in real life.<br><br>A future engineer is a student that
                leaves the university with a practical understanding of how
                things work in real life. They will also get experience from
                teamwork, project management, economics, all that comes in
                handy when starting life as an engineer.<br><br>We care about
                the world around us and we use a lot of our energy to design
                creative and innovative engineering solutions for a better
                future. The environment is very important to us, and so is
                education.<br><br>We arrange lectures and discussions at high
                schools and other educational institutions to promote that
                science and physics can be really cool. Just look at us.
                We design sophisticated formula cars with passion in every
                component.</p>

              <p><b>THE COMPETITION</b></p>
              <p>Formula Student is an annual competition arranged by The Institution
                 of Mechanical Engineers. Formula Student has events in USA, Australia,
                Germany, England and a lot more.<br><br>The purpose is to design, build, test,
                and race a small-scale formula style racing car. The car has to be built
                using a comprehensive rulebook. The purpose of the competition is in
                other words not to create race car drivers, but to give the students an
                impression of a comprehensive engineering project.<br><br>Formula Student
                also has a lot of different events other than driving. Cars are judged on
                a variety of static and dynamic events including: Design, cost, business,
                acceleration, sprint, endurance and fuel economy. This means we have to
                work together as a team to get a respective score and a respective
                position.<br><br>The extensive regulation makes sure that everything in the car
                is made safe. Everything is checked by judges before the car can be raced.
                A lot of the teams doesn't even get through this event, called
                scrutineering. This is where past experiences and teamwork come in handy.</p>
